                well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which is expressed in a
                sentence called the topic sentence.
                A topic sentence has several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s thesis
                statement;
                it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the sentences; and it advises the reader
                of the subject to be discussed and how the paragraph
                will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a paragraph to determine the
                subject and perspective of the paragraph.
                That’s why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the paragraph. In some
                cases, however, it’s more effective to place
                another sentence before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current paragraph to the
                previous one, or one providing background information.

                cientisist have learned to supplement the sens of sight in numerous way. In front of the tiny pupil
                of
                the eye they put, on Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see 2000 times
                farther into the depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged as a microscope
                into a drop of water or blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living creatures there,
                many of which are among man’s most dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant happenings on
                earth, they use some of the previously wasted electromagnetic waves to carry television images which
                they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a screen with electrons in a vacuum. Or they can
                bring happenings of long ago and far away as colored motion pictures, by arranging silver atoms and
                color-absorbing molecules to force light waves into the patterns of original reality. Or if we want to
                see into the center of a steel casting or the chest of an injured child, they send the information on a
                beam of penetrating short-wave X rays, and then convert it back into images we can see on a screen or
                photograph. THUS ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION YET DISCOVERED HAS BEEN USED TO EXTEND
                OUR SENSE OF SIGHT IN SOME WAY.
